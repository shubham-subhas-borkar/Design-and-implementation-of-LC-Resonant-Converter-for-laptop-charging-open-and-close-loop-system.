# Design-and-implementation-of-LC-Resonant-Converter-for-laptop-charging-open-and-close-loop-system.

The different design phases for a resonant DC-DC converter with a Half-Bridge Inductor-
Capacitor (LC) topology are shown in this work. It can be suggested that this converter be
used for battery charging applications in UPS. The suggested DC-DC converter is built to
deliver the most power possible from the DC Link's input voltage to the battery. Averaging
Current Mode Controller is used to regulate the output voltage. According to the suggested
design strategy, variable input voltages between 35V and 40V are used to regulate the output
DC voltage at a constant 12V DC.
The design of resonant tank is done for line regulation, load regulation, and efficiency.
Detailed design and selection of Mosfet, Inductor, Capacitor, Transformer, Rectifier circuit,
Filter circuit and Load design is done. The mathematical modeling for the resonant converter
is carried out by First Harmonic Approximation (FHA) and Small signal modeling for series
resonant converter.
The simulation is run on the MATLAB/Simulink platform using the designed parameters,
and the simulation results validate the resonant converter's performance in terms of overall
high efficiency.
